LABYRINTH: By Connor Kirby and Tyler DeWitt
===========================================

Overview
--------

  Labyrinth is a game with the goal to traverse the maze with a ball, controlled by the tilting of the board it sits on, without falling into numerous holes on the floor.
Our version has the player running against the clock, the quicker the ball reaches the goal the higher the score. The current score gets tallied up with the total score once a run is completed. The player has three lives to rack up the highest total score he or she can. The knobs on each side of the screen turn based on your board tilt.
